        <p>This is the start of the recipe for an amazingly<em>gooey, stringy and flavorful</em><strong>Cheese Pizza</strong> 
            that we know you will love!</p>
            <p><strong>Ingredients</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Yeast:</strong> Instant yeast makes the job quicker. You need 1 standard packet.</li>
                <li><strong>Water:</strong>Use warm water to cur down on the rise time, about 105of-115of. Anything over 130of is too hot and may burn the pizza.</li>
                <li><strong>Flour:</strong>Use unbleached all purpose white flour in the pizza crust. Bleaching the flour strips away some of the protein, which will affect how much water the flour absorbs.</li>
                <li><strong>Oil:</strong>Extra virgin olive oil adds wonderful flavor to the dough. Don't forget to brush the dough with olive oil before adding the toppings, which prevents the crust from tasting soggy.</li>
                <li><strong>Salt:</strong>Adds flavor.</li>
                <li><strong>Sugar:</strong>A little sugar increases the yeast's activity and tenderizes the pizza dough.</li>
                <li><strong>Cornmeal:</strong>Use cornmeal to dust the pizza pan it gives the pizza crust a little extra flavor and crisp.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Steps</strong></p>
                <ol>
                    <lI>Prepare the pizza dough through step 6 including preheating the oven to 475 degrees.</lI>
                    <li>Top the dough with the pizza sauce of your choice,the cheese of your choice (preferabbly mozzarella if you can't decide),grate the cheese and sprinkle some basil.</li>
                    <li>Bake for 12-15 minutes. For the last minute, i move the oven rack to the top rack to really brown the edges but that is optional.</li>
                    <li>Slice the hot pizza and serve immediately. Cover leftover pizza tightly and store in the refrigerator.</li>
                </ol>
