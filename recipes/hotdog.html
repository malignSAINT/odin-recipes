			<img src="../images/hotdog.jpg" alt="Weird looking hotdog">
			<p>So some day the old gods may burst from the earth and they might be hungry so just in case they are we got you covered so the world may be saved! The good thing about this hotdog is its from an ancient text explaining what the old gods loved and why it was this hotdog. We wont go too in depth with why they loved this hotdog because it doesnt really matter. It is at least edible for human beings so thats nice.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Ingredients</strong></p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Hotdogs:</strong>This will depend on how many you need for serving size but the recipe will be able to make enough for four hotdogs. If you need more then just double the ingredients per four hotdogs.</li>
					<li><strong>Bacon:</strong>At least four strips of bacon per hotdog. We need to also include one table spoon of brown sugar and one teaspoon of bbq or some steak seasoning.</li>
					<li><strong>Buns:</strong>Use the buns of your choice</li>
					<li><strong>Tomatos:</strong>We prefer roma tomatos but beefsteak tomatos work fine.</li>
					<li><strong>Iceberg Lettuce:</strong>Half a cup of shredded iceberg lettuce</li>
					<li><strong>Mayonnaise:</strong>Four tablespoons of that white stuff called mayo. Dont eat it alone...I mean you can but thats kinda interesting.</li>
				</ul>

				<p><strong>Steps</strong></p>
				<ol>
					<li>Preheat the grill to 350. Grill the hotdogs on all sides until slightly charred. Typically about 6-8 minutes.</li>
					<li>Place the bacon on a non stick aluminum foil. Sprinkle the bacon with the bbq and sugar, just on the top. Place on the indirect heat of the gril and cook until done. Typically about 18-20 minutes.</li>
					<li>Line the sides of each bun with the tomatoe slices, rest the hot dogs on top and add mayonnaise, using it to glue the lettuce and bacon on top.</li>
				</ol>
